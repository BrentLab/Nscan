# You can redirect this output to a file and use it as a config file.
# Make sure you set all locations according to your system!

# location for storage of temporary files (must be large enough to store informant genome)

# N-SCAN can be downloaded from http://mblab.wustl.edu/software/

# location of RepeatMasker program
# RepeatMasker can be downloaded from http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMDownload.html
# If your sequence is already masked or you do not want to mask, 
# you can run Nscan_driver.pl with the --nomask option
# the repmask path will be ignored

# location of Blastz program
# Blastz and multiz can be downloaded from http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/
# If you already have an ALIGN format file, 
# you can run Nscan_driver.pl with the --blastz=[align file] option
# in that case, you can remove the following three paths, or leave them:
# they will be ignored.
blastz=/usr/bin/blastz

# location of blastz output formatter. This program comes with Multiz

# location of informant sequence file. 
# This file should be in (multiple) fasta format with Blastz headers:
